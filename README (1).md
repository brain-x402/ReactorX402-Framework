## 🧩 Overview

**ReacotX402** is an advanced AI-integrated blockchain framework built to **reverse the pay-per-use economy**.  
Instead of users paying per AI or computational interaction, ReacotX402 rewards contributors, developers, and AI agents **for usage itself** — creating a **self-sustaining “Get per use” protocol**.

The system operates across **AI agents**, **IoT devices**, and **Solana-based smart contracts**.  
Each interaction between user agents, AI systems, and blockchain nodes generates **work proofs** that result in automated **payments** from the protocol pool.

## 🧬 Reverse Program Concept

Traditionally:  
> 🧾 You pay to use AI.

In **ReacotX402**:  
> 💰 You earn when AI (or users) use your agents.

The framework connects your **AI service logic** to Solana programs managing:
- 🔹 _Identity Registry_ (agent ownership and verification)  
- 🔹 _Payment Protocol_ (smart contracts for get-per-use model)  
- 🔹 _Reputation Registry_ (on-chain performance & trust scoring)

## 🧠 Architecture Flow

**Flow Summary:**
1. **User (Agent)** initiates interaction.  
2. **AI Service (Python + SDKs)** processes and triggers blockchain events.  
3. **Solana Smart Contracts** handle proof-of-work and rewards.  
4. The **Identity** and **Reputation Registries** maintain decentralized AI records.  
5. Service completion triggers **automated reward distribution**.
